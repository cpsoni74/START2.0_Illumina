This module contains a function to read FASTQ files, filter reads using their Phred
quality scores, and write the passing sequences to a text file.

        typically the diversity sequence
    exclude_at_end : int
        Number of bases to exclude from analysis at the end of the sequence, often
        due to decreased quality scores

    Returns
    ---

    stats : list
        Statistics describing number of sequences passing or failing on each parameter

    Notes

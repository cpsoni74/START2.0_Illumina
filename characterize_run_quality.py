This module contains a function to characterize the quality of a run based on the
Phred quality scores.

    Parameters
    ---
    fastq_file_name : str
        File to be characterized
    working_folder_name : str
        Folder containing .fastq files
    limit : int
        How many sequences to characterize
    expected_sequence : str
        The full expected sequences, including excluded positions
    exclude_at_start : int
        Number of bases to exclude from analysis at the beginning of the sequence,
        typically the diversity sequence
    exclude_at_end : int
        Number of bases to exclude from analysis at the end of the sequence, often
        due to decreased quality scores
    randomized_bases : list
        List of randomized base coordinates

    Notes
    ---
    Output plots are placed working_folder_name\Plots\Run Quality

    The number of sequences to be characterized is limited because reading the whole
    file is very slow.
